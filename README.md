## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

In 2018 HackerRank has conducted a Survey of 25,000 professionals and students,
I found the data Interesting and was curious to know answers to the following questions.
1.  Which Platform do people use the most to learn code?
2.  What Qualities Hiring managers are looking for in candidates?
3.  What people look for in a company when looking for job opportunities?
